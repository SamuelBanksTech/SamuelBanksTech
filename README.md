## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sam

A lifelong enthusiast for everything development related. I have spent the last 20 years in software development transitioning through a multitude of languages Starting with Visual Fox Pro and Visual Basic way back when right through to Go (GoLang) which is now my main language.

My extensive knowledge goes beyond software development and extends into cloud architecture, hardware, and networking too, where I can put all my skills into creating massively scalable and high-performing platforms used by millions of users worldwide.

In my time I have created platforms that serve global user bases on social media, process terabytes of analytical data daily for SEO and marketing platforms, perform huge web scraping tasks, and many more exciting platforms.

I specialise in backend development usually concentrating on core microservices (usually using GRPC for communication), APIs (usually REST based), tooling, and infrastructure, along with usually leading a team of 4 - 20 other engineers.

Below is a list of technologies that I have been using recently for my platform development at an expert level, this is not an exhaustive list of my skills.
